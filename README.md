# Inflation Forecasting in Poland (2025/01 - 2025/04)

This project models and forecasts inflation in Poland using ARIMA and ARIMAX models. External variables include wages, oil prices, unemployment, and exchange rates. The best-performing model is selected based on out-of-sample performance and AIC.

## Key Findings
- ARIMAX model with external regressors (wages, unemployment, oil prices) significantly improves forecast accuracy.
- The model captures COVID-era volatility using exogenous indicators.
